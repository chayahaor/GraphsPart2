# Graphs SQL/C# Group Project

Merging what we learned in C# and SQL, we created this final project as a class.
We took the data from a database, containing graphs, nodes, and edges, and made a visualization using a C# Windows Form.
We also implemented graph algorithms (Dijkstra's Algorithm, Topological Sort, Prim's and Kruskal's MST), and displayed
them using the GUI.
