# Graphs SQL/C# Group Project - Updated Version

This is an updated, enhanced version of the Graphs Project that we did as a class last semester.
The project merged what we learned in C# and SQL to create a program that implements popular graph algorithms.
We took data containing graphs, nodes, and edges from a database; with a visualization using a C# Windows Form.
We implemented Dijkstra's Algorithm, Topological Sort, Prim's and Kruskal's MST, 
and displayed them on the graph using the GUI.
This improved version updates the node coordinates when a new node is added, 
has a clearer GUI visualization, and streamlines the algorithms and their implementations.
